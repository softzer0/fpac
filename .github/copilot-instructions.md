- [ ] **Customize the Project** - Implement FPAC contracts, oracle system, and deployment scripts
- [ ] **Install Required Extensions** - No specific extensions required
- [ ] **Compile the Project** - Compile all smart contracts
- [ ] **Create and Run Task** - Set up build and deployment tasks
- [ ] **Launch the Project** - Deploy to testnet
- [ ] **Ensure Documentation is Complete** - Complete README and deployment guide

## Project Components

### Smart Contracts

- **FPAC Token**: Main ERC-20 token pegged to FAIT
- **PegEngine**: Core logic for maintaining the peg through mint/burn operations
- **OracleHub**: Manages real-time economic data feeds
- **ReserveManager**: Handles collateral and backing assets
- **GovernanceToken**: For decentralized governance
- **Treasury**: Manages protocol funds and operations

### Oracle System

- Real-time CPI data integration
- Basket of goods price tracking
- Automated data validation and consensus

### Deployment Infrastructure

- Comprehensive deployment scripts
- Testnet and mainnet configurations
- Verification and setup automation
